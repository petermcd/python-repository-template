# Welcome to your brand-new repository

Welcome to your brand-new Python repository. This repository is intended to be used as a starting point for your Python
projects.

The repository contains a setup.sh file. Running this will carry out the following tasks:

* Set up the licence file with your name and the current year.
* Set up or remove the funding links in GitHub.
* Update bug and feature request issue templates with the specified handlers username.
* Set up SonarQube with your server details or remove the configuration files if you are not using SonarQube.
* Delete the setup.sh file.

Things you should do:

* Update pyproject.toml with your project details.
* Update the `README.md` file to describe your project.

This template assumes that you will be using uv for project management and GitHub workflows.

##

The following are a few things that I plan to do to extend this template:

* Update the bash script so that the SonarQube section is removed from uv.yml
